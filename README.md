# Image_Classification_CNN
🚀 Image Classification with CNN on CIFAR-10
🧠 Project Overview:
This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 diverse categories:

Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck

The model automatically learns spatial hierarchies and visual patterns directly from raw pixels — no manual feature extraction required. This demonstrates the power of deep learning in solving real-world image recognition problems.

🧰 Tech Stack:
Python

TensorFlow / Keras – Model building & training

NumPy & Pandas – Data preprocessing

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Training insights & visualization

🔁 Pipeline:
Load and normalize CIFAR-10 images

Construct a multi-layer CNN architecture

Train and validate the model

Evaluate performance using accuracy & loss plots

Visualize predictions and class-wise accuracy

🎯 Key Outcome:
Achieved strong classification performance by training a CNN that generalizes well on unseen test data. The model demonstrates how deep learning can handle complex image classification with minimal preprocessing and maximum efficiency.
